/*
Objects that are const, and references or pointers to const objects,
may call only const member functions.
*/

/*
if the member was declared as a const member function, then the definition must also spec-
ify const after the parameter list.
*/


/*
The IO classes are types that cannot be copied
*/

/*
constructors may not be declared as const
When we create a const object of a class type, the object does not
assume its ¡°constness¡± until after the constructor completes the object¡¯s initial-
ization. Thus, constructors can write to const objects during their construction.
*/


/*
if our class does not explicitly define any constructors, the compiler will
implicitly define the default constructor for us

If we define any
constructors, the class will not have a default constructor unless we define that
constructor ourselves.

Remember that objects of
built-in or compound type (such as arrays and pointers) that are defined inside a
block have undefined value when they are default initialized
*/

/*
When a member is omitted from the constructor initializer list, it is im-
plicitly initialized using the same process as is used by the synthesized default
constructor. In this case, those members are initialized by the in-class initializers.
*/

/*
It is usually best for a constructor to use an in-class initializer if one exists and
gives the member the correct value. On the other hand, if your compiler does not
yet support in-class initializers, then every constructor should explicitly initialize
every member of built-in type.
*/

/*
Constructors should not override in-class initializers except to use a
different initial value. If you can¡¯t use in-class initializers, each con-
structor should explicitly initialize every member of built-in type.
*/


/*
Constructors have no return type
*/


/*
Even though the constructor initializer list is empty, the members of this
object are still initialized before the constructor body is executed.
*/

/*
Members that do not appear in the constructor initializer list are initialized by
the corresponding in-class initializer (if there is one) or are default initialized.
*/



/*
the synthesized versions for copy, assignment, and destruction work
correctly for classes that have vector or string members. When we copy or
assign an object that has a vector member, the vector class takes care of copy-
ing or assigning the elements in that member. When the object is destroyed, the
vector member is destroyed, which in turn destroys the elements in the vector.
Similarly for strings.
*/

/*
in-class initializers must use either the = form of initialization
 or the direct form of initialization using curly braces .
*/

 
/*
It is important to understand that a friend declaration affects access but is not a
declaration in an ordinary sense.
*/


/*
Members are initialized in the order in which they appear in the class defini-
tion: The first member is initialized first, then the next, and so on. The order in
which initializers appear in the constructor initializer list does not change the or-
der of initialization.
*/

/*
It is a good idea to write constructor initializers in the same order as the
members are declared. Moreover, when possible, avoid using mem-
bers to initialize other members.
*/

/*
A constructor that supplies default arguments for all its parameters also
defines the default constructor.

/*
