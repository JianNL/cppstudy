	which r refers, we can use r in an expression, such as r + 0, which is an expression
	that yields a value that has a nonreference type.
	On the other hand, the dereference operator is an example of an expression
	for which decltype returns a reference.As we’ve seen, when we dereference a
	pointer, we get the object to which the pointer points.Moreover, we can assign to
	that object.Thus, the type deduced by decltype(*p) is int&, not plain int.
